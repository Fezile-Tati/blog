Github allows its users to host their server for free indefinitely until otherwise stated. What is most pleasing is the performance we have experienced taking into consideration that we are not paying.\nSeamless integration  Updating, editing or fixing bugs on our blog is as simple as can be in my humble opinion.

Google is known for their VPN because of the performance it offers, they are two option premium tier and standard. The difference being, Premium tier is built on fiber-optic cabling. VPS stands for Virtual Private Server and is offered by cloud providers and web host providers. VPS does not mean non-sharing, you are still sharing a physical server unless a dedicated option is selected.
