## GitHub 2021

<hr>
Github is a repository where Developer can store their code, collaborate and 
find solutions to any problems they are facing.Millions of Data-ScientistS, software-Engineers and SME companies build, ship, and maintain their software on GitHub. In fact GitHub is the largest, most popular and most advanced development platform in the world. Github is reported to have roughly 3 million organisations , 56 million developers and 100 million repositories.

##### Here are five reasons we use GitHub


<hr>

1. Free hosting


Our Web app currently is running two golang servers, one of which is hosted on google app engine the other on github. We decided that this was the best solution because it is extremely cost efficient and delivers the expected performances. Github allows its users to host their server for free indefinitely until otherwise stated.  What is most pleasing is the performance we have experienced taking into consideration that we are not paying.

2. Seamless integration

Updating, editing or fixing bugs on our blog  is as simple as can be in my humble opinion. Github makes developing code, storing coding and deployment a quick process. Our software processes are so well integrated and in sync with Github, 
we store our production code in their repository and in the cloud as well. Github has great integration with other external APIS such cloud integration with Google and Amazon cloud services.

3. Supportive  community

Github was designed with collaboration in mind, it has a thriving community that assists each other when possible.
Github is in my opinion, one of  if not the best platform for IT technicians  and DataScientist . 
Every SME and Even Large Corporate giants should use it, code can be publicly distributed or private repositories can be created for sensitive data. 
Microsoft was willing to spend more than $ 7 Billion to acquire the API.

4. Free repository 

Github is free for use for the community, users don't pay to save their data or to utilities their API. 
If billing is enquired it is often for tremendously large projects that should rather be hosted in one of the three top cloud providers
AWS, GOOGLE OR ASURE.

5. Free hosting

During the development of solo or collaborative projects,
 Github provides you with the ability to track and monitor changes to your source code
as well as gives you the option to revert back to the previous iteration of your project.
