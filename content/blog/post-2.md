<hr>

Javascript is not an easy programming language for beginners and has a relatively long learning curve. learning JavaScript often requires individuals to also learn other markup languages such HTML and CSS. Many Developers have expressed their displeasure in using the language, I am not the biggest javascript fan myself. It is possible to pick-up and get going coding the language even if you have slight coding experience, it will just be a serious challenge for most.

With the development of modern plugin for site generates like wordpress and wix, javascript is 
not as much of a necessity as it used to be. A slow approaching trend of no code is bubbling up, this movement aims to vastly reduce the amount of coding that is required to build complex API. Although the systems that deliver a no code platform require some form of coding themselves, therefore to some extent javascript and some other popular languages will always be relevant. 
JavaScript is considered the king of the browser and browser are going anywhere any time soon. JavaScript is the only language which runs on the browser as far as I am aware.
