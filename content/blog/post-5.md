## Go is poping


<hr>

“Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software “ -Go team.
The language was designed by some of  Computer scientists' biggest pioneers. Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike and Ken Thompson,
the language has been around for sometime now  and has gained popularity amongst the masses. Here are some reasons why Go is popular.

##### Concurrency

Go is designed to take advantage of multiple CPU cores, the go scheduler is where the magic happens. The scheduler takes care of running  goroutines at the most appropriate time, golangs high level abstraction of concurrency implementation makes running concurrent operations relatively simple compared to other programming languages.Go's native support for concurrency and parallelism is one of the reasons go is so special.

##### Less Error prone

Go is a statically typed language, ultimately this results in most errors being detected before the
Code is compiled. Run time errors are possible, but overall writing code in golang result in less
time debugging.

##### Writing tests in golang is a blast

Testing modules in go is not as complex as it may seem,
go has excellent builtin tools that simplify the testing process.

###### Runing test is as simple as
```Go 
 go test (filename).go

```

##### Cross-platform compatibility 

The go compiler is capable of generating binary for most OS platforms.
This makes cross-platform code porting easy and offer greater flexibility
For developers. Firms are able to save Finances and reap the benefits of having to 
Spend less money on hiring developers.
