## GCP laytency in Africa


<hr>

Google cloud infrastructure is best suited for organisations that require global coverage rather than just local south african coverage.
Although South african can enjoy Google cloud services due to their world-class fiber optic network and a pop(points of presence) in south africa,
hosting your website in the nearest region europe-west and asia can result in a slight performance hit.
There are numerous ways to overcome this problem such as website optimization, using a cloud CDN and more.
Google Cloud is considered one of the top three players in public cloud space, along with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft. 
Google in the past  have expressed an interest in getting into the African market "at some point".

AWS and Microsoft Azure both have an impressive Market Share in SA already.
Microsoft have recently opened two data centre regions in SA, unveiling cloud data centres in Johannesburg and Cape Town. 
AWS has also recently established a data centre in SA (Cape Town).
Competition only seems to be getting hotter as Huawei Cloud service continues to persist, known for their affordability offerings  geared towards commercial services in SA.

1. Avoid using large uncompressed images and videos on your website

   Aim to use small files like JPG that require minimal processing from the server and client. 
   An online service like Tiny JPG will automatically compress and preserve an image for you

2. Implement caching into your API,
  
   whether you use wordpress or are coding from the ground-up or
   using a good quality caching plugin can work wonder for your website, And improve the user experience.
   The aim of implementing caching is to improve your websites loading time, 
   essential  static components of your website such as images ect are saved  onto your browser or a CDN server.
   That way, when a user tries to access your website, the lighter static page will load first, significantly improving load time. 


3. If your using a pre-built theme, lightweight is the way to go

   Ensure that the themes you are using are fast, browser friendly and SEO optimised. 
   A Lot of themes are unnecessarily  packaged as large or data-heavy , 
   the result of using such package themes is that they  take longer to load.
