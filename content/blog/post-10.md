#### Despite it slower performance million if developer, data scientist and other love python

 ##### here are five reason why i think python is so popular


* learning curve 

Python has a short learning curve and is often recommended to beginners.
the language has a high level abstraction implementation which make writing python 
fair less complex than c or c++ for example.

* Python has a Strong Community 

 writing programs in python can be considered easier than writing programs in 
 other fairly new languages that have a fairly small community.
 Pythons large community members contribute to open source software and libraries
 which eases the development phase. Another benefit of having a strong community is
 that overcoming barriers and challenges that occur during the development
 are often solved faster due to the large number of tutorials and available
 information on the topic.  

 Python is one of the most widely used programming languages,
 it has been around for many years,

* Development Time

  The average amount of time it takes to write identical programs in python and 
  java for example differ significantly, python requires less lines of code to program
  identical software written in java. Python Code is also easier to maintain due to the 
  ease of reading it. Shorter development time results in lower costs and overall expenditure.
