An example of Ux is the joy a visitor felt when searching for a particular component of the API like the home button on their favorite site or the frustration of not finding the account setting in the API. UX and UI are critical for the success of any business or personal agenda and the two are inseparable when delivering a good API.

 UI deals with the aesthetic of the API,  what a visitor(client) sees throughout your mobile app or  website. 
 UI is the design and structural  blueprint of the API, it determines how the API  looks and how customers will
 interact with the component parts of the API.
